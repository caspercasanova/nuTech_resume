      "My journey began when I was recruited to secretive group of Free Masons. I was mentored in the Arts of Imagination in the damp, dark bellows of my Universiti's broiler rooms. During my studies I had developed a terrible sickness that left me both scarred and empowered. I was capable of glimpsing into the near future. One such vision has taken me to a secret facility in a desert, where beings not of this time or realm appeared.

      'I crossed paths with a man named Barney and told him of vision I had. He told me he had been expecting me. No more than 10 minutes of entering the facilities campus chaos broke out. The Earth Quaked and explosions of a peculular kind could be heard in the distance. Stange creatures starting appearing out of flashed of what seemed like lightning  in a small ball. Fearing for my life, I ran to a shed which had been equiped with various weapons. I grabbed a handgun and multiple magazines and some first aid kits, found a tram entrance and entered the depths of the mysterius facility. After what seemed like an hour, I departed the tram and found my self at the "Lambda Research Facility". A scientist named Rosenburg had allowed me access and told me of a dream where a figure instructed him to guide me to the Temporal Flux Emmitor. He started the machine was told to run through the spinning vortex of light. I did... and nothing has been the same since.',

      'Pyramid of the Sun. After running through the portal, I had awoken on the Pinnacle of the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacán. I knew where I was due to the history books of my highschool days, however, something was off. The people. They were... AZTECS! What happened? It seemed I had jumped in a Time Warping Cascade. I thought they were only possible in theory, but it seems they had not been. Motezuma himself had introduced himself to me. He was capable of speaking telekinetically. He spoke perfect English and explained how he was to be my mentor for the next day. That day seemed like 1000 years. He tought me much, but most importantly he guided me through a vision of the past.

      "The Mad Hermit Al-Hazrad, Lost City, and so I did. I crawled downwards through narrow shafts and small caverns of sand and limestone for what seemed like hours. A pool of reverberating black ooze swirled before my eyes. I walked in, taking small steps. I had no sense of fear anymore. I was mad. The pool's ooze began climbing up my legs and torse, engulfing me. I didn't stuggle. It would have been pointless.",
